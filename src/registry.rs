//! Common registry operations for PATH management.
//!
//! This module provides unified access to Windows Registry for reading and writing
//! PATH environment variables, eliminating code duplication across modules.
//!
//! ## Race Condition Protection
//!
//! Write operations use file-based locking via `fs2` crate to prevent concurrent
//! modifications to PATH by multiple spath processes. Lock files are stored in
//! `%LOCALAPPDATA%\spath\locks\`.
